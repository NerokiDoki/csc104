Assignment 2.2: CSS Text Styling Readme file

Description:

For this assignment, the goal is to demonstrate how CSS files can change the style of a webpage. The site used was https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii, which is copyright-free and publicly accessible. The output of the two associated files with this assignment will provide a stylized version of the text copied from Article II, with its own CSS sheet that changes the background, text, colors, fonts, and font sizes. The two files used were Assignment 2-2.html and style.css, both of which can be found on my GitHub here.
